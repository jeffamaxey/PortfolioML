Welcome to PortfolioML's documentation!
=======================================
PortfolioML was born as part of an university exam at Università di Pisa for the
"Computhing Methods and Experimental Physics and Data Analysis" course.
Authors: Angelo Lasala, Daniele Maria Di Nosse, Raffaele Paradiso.

This package contains functions used to forecast stock market returns on a fraction of the S&P500 index.
The procedure used is mainly focused on the following two articles and one book:
